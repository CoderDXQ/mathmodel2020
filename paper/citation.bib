	abstract="State-of-the-art algorithms for hard computational problems often expose many parameters that can be modified to improve empirical performance. However, manually exploring the resulting combinatorial space of parameter settings is tedious and tends to lead to unsatisfactory outcomes. Recently, automated approaches for solving this algorithm configuration problem have led to substantial improvements in the state of the art for solving various problems. One promising approach constructs explicit regression models to describe the dependence of target algorithm performance on parameter settings; however, this approach has so far been limited to the optimization of few numerical algorithm parameters on single instances. In this paper, we extend this paradigm for the first time to general algorithm configuration problems, allowing many categorical parameters and optimization for sets of instances. We experimentally validate our new algorithm configuration procedure by optimizing a local search and a tree search solver for the propositional satisfiability problem (SAT), as well as the commercial mixed integer programming (MIP) solver CPLEX. In these experiments, our procedure yielded state-of-the-art performance, and in many cases outperformed the previous best configuration approach.",

	abstract = {The 3Sigma cluster scheduling system uses job runtime histories in a new way. Knowing how long each job will execute enables a scheduler to more effectively pack jobs with diverse time concerns (e.g., deadline vs. the-sooner-the-better) and placement preferences on heterogeneous cluster resources. But, existing schedulers use single-point estimates (e.g., mean or median of a relevant subset of historical runtimes), and we show that they are fragile in the face of real-world estimate error profiles. In particular, analysis of job traces from three different large-scale cluster environments shows that, while the runtimes of many jobs can be predicted well, even state-of-the-art predictors have wide error profiles with 8--23% of predictions off by a factor of two or more. Instead of reducing relevant history to a single point, 3Sigma schedules jobs based on full distributions of relevant runtime histories and explicitly creates plans that mitigate the effects of anticipated runtime uncertainty. Experiments with workloads derived from the same traces show that 3Sigma greatly outperforms a state-of-the-art scheduler that uses point estimates from a state-of-the-art predictor; in fact, the performance of 3Sigma approaches the end-to-end performance of a scheduler based on a hypothetical, perfect runtime predictor. 3Sigma reduces SLO miss rate, increases cluster goodput, and improves or matches latency for best effort jobs.},
